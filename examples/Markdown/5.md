# Enough with the tease, how do I get started?

You can install the package with the following line of code. Make sure you have **devtools** installed first, of course:

```R
devtools::install_github("martinctc/parallaxr")
```

On the [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/martinctc/parallaxr), look inside the `examples` folder. You will find the script and the Markdown documents that were used to produce this page. Here is a snippet of the starter code, but please visit the repo for the latest version:

```R
## Load packages
library(parallaxr)

## Character vector of all MD files
all_md_str <- list.files(path = "examples/Markdown", full.names = TRUE)


## Loop through each MD file, parse, and return a single tibble
md_tibble <-
  all_md_str %>%
  purrr::map_dfr(parse_md) # Return a tibble with row-binding

## Output HTML file

generate_scroll_doc(path = "examples/parallaxr-examples-output.html",
                    inputs = md_tibble)
```

More documentation is available for the individual functions, e.g. 

```R
?generate_scroll_doc
```
